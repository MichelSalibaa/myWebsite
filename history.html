                        <h2>From Tim Berners-Lee to Modern Browsers</h2>
                        <p>The World Wide Web began in 1989–1991 with Tim Berners‑Lee’s proposals and the first web server and browser at CERN. Early browsers (WorldWideWeb, Mosaic) made hypertext public and proved that documents linked across networks were practical. Mosaic’s popularity during the early 1990s accelerated the web’s adoption by the public and led to the browser wars of the late 1990s, which shaped modern web standards and commercial strategies.</p>

                        <h2>Standards, Engines and Interoperability</h2>
                        <p>Standards bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and WHATWG have been central to defining HTML, CSS, DOM and other platform features. The shift from proprietary engine behavior toward standardized APIs improved interoperability. The introduction of JavaScript in 1995 and later engines (Trident, Gecko, WebKit, Blink) turned browsers into full application platforms.</p>

                        <h2>Evolution & trends</h2>
                        <p>Key trends include progressive enhancement, performance optimization, developer toolchains and privacy/security features (same‑site cookies, CORS, Content Security Policy). The rise of single‑page applications and PWAs has blurred lines between websites and native apps, while WebAssembly adds near‑native performance for compute‑heavy tasks. Accessibility and inclusive design have also gained prominence.</p>

                        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                        <p>Expect continued emphasis on privacy-first architectures, decentralization (e.g., decentralized identifiers and peer-to-peer protocols), and improved first‑class support for multimedia, 3D (WebGPU, WebXR) and real‑time communication (WebRTC). Standards and open-source engines will remain essential to keep the Web open and interoperable.</p>
